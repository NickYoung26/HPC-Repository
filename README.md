First assignment for PH510. 

The aim is to examine and then improve a small program for use on Strathclyde’s Wee-Archie
parallel computer. Specifically look at optimising its performance for parallel computation while
also retaining at least a minimum level of accuracy for the result and improving readability, coding
style and the correctness of what it does.
