First assignment for PH510. 

Original code provided - ‘badcode.py’
Parallelised code developed - ‘goodcode.py’
sbatch script ran on wee-archie – ‘assignment1-sbatch-script’ 
slurm output from wee-archie - ‘wee-archie-slurm-output’

The aim is to examine and then improve a small program for use on Strathclyde’s Wee-Archie
parallel computer. Specifically look at optimising its performance for parallel computation while
also retaining at least a minimum level of accuracy for the result and improving readability, coding
style and the correctness of what it does.
